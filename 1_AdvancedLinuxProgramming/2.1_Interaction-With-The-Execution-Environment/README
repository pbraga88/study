GNU/Linux Command-Line Conventions
==================================
Almost all GNU/Linux programs obey some conventions about how command-line arguments are
interpreted. The arguments that programs expect fall into two categories: options (or flags) and
other arguments. Options modify how the program behaves, while other arguments provide inputs
(for instance, the names of input files).
Options come in two forms:
	
	• Short options consist of a single hyphen and a single character (usually a lowercase or
	uppercase letter). Short options are quicker to type.
	
	• Long options consist of two hyphens, followed by a name made of lowercase and uppercase
	letters and hyphens. Long options are easier to remember and easier to read (in shell scripts,
	for instance).
