Your shell, like any other program, has an environment. Shells provide methods for examining and
modifying the environment directly. To print the current environment in your shell, invoke the
printenv program. Various shells have different built-in syntax for using environment variables;
the following is the syntax for Bourne-style shells.
â€¢ The shell automatically creates a shell variable for each environment variable that it finds,
so you can access environment variable values using the $varname syntax. For instance:
[pbraga ~ ]$echo $USER
pbraga
[pbraga ~ ]$echo $HOME
/home/pbraga
