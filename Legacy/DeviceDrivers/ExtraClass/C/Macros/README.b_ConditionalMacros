Conditional Macros
==================
Conditional macros are very useful to apply conditions. Code snippets are guarded with a condition checking if a certain macro is defined or not. They are very helpful in large project having code segregated as per releases of project. If some part of code needs to be executed for release 1 of project and some other part of code needs to be executed for release 2, then it can be easily achieved through conditional macros.
