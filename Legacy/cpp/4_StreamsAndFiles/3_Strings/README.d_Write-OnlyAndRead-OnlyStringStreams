Write-Only and Read-Only String Streams
=======================================
As seguintes classes permitem operações 'Write-Only' e 'Read-Only' nos streams:
- std::ostringstream
    - Output characters to a string.
- std::istringstream
    - Input characters from a string.

Exemplo:
|    // Create an ostringstream object, which supports write-only operations.
|    std::ostringstream stream1;
|    
|    stream1 << "Jane" << " " << 42 << " " << 15000 << std::endl;
|    
|    // Create an istringstream object, which supports read-only operations.
|    std::istringstream stream2(stream1.str());
|    
|    // Read formatted data from istringstream.
|    std::string name;
|    int age;
|    double salary;
|    stream2 >> name >> age >> salary;
|    
|    std::cout
|        << "Name: " << name << std::endl
|        << "Age: " << age << std::endl
|        << "Salary:" << salary << std::endl;
