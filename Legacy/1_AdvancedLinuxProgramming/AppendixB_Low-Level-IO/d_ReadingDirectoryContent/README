Reading Directory Content
=========================
To read the contents of a directory, follow these steps:

1. Call opendir, passing the path of the directory that you want to examine. The call to
opendir returns a DIR* handle, which you'll use to access the directory contents. If an error
occurs, the call returns NULL.

2. Call readdir repeatedly, passing the DIR* handle that you obtained from opendir. Each
time you call readdir, it returns a pointer to a struct dirent instance corresponding to
the next directory entry. When you reach the end of the directory's contents, readdir
returns NULL.
The struct dirent that you get back from readdir has a field d_name, which contains the
name of the directory entry.

3. Cal closedir, passing the DIR* handle, to end the directory listing operation.
