When invoking a program, it is sometimes useful to redirect both standard output and standard
error to a file or pipe. The syntax for doing this varies among shells; for Bourne-style shells
(including bash, the default shell on most GNU/Linux distributions), the syntax is this:

	% program > output_file.txt 2>&1
	% program 2>&1 | filter'

The 2>&1 syntax indicates that file descriptor 2 (stderr) should be merged into file descriptor 1
(stdout). Note that 2>&1 must follow a file redirection (the first example) but must precede a pipe
redirection (the second example).
