Macros Definition
=================
Macros are generally used to define constant values that are being used repeatedly in program. Macros can even accept arguments and such macros are known as function-like macros. It can be useful if tokens are concatenated into code to simplify some complex declarations. Macros provide text replacement functionality at pre-processing time.
