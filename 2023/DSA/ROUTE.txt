Concepts:
    Data-structure:
        Hash Table - must be able to explain how internals of hash tables work for example hashing.
            * Review content from course. You got it!

        Linked List -
    Algorithms:
        Big O notation - 
        Breadth First Search/Depth First Search
        Binary Search 
        Merge Sort
        Quick Sort
    General:
        - C++ Concepts
            - ITERATORS
        - Common Algorithms like:
            * accumulate(vec.begin(), vec.end()), find(vec.begin(), vec.end()), sort(vec.begin(), vec.end()) and etc


Arrays, Circular Buffer,  Linked List, Stack, Queue, FIFO, LIFO, Trees, Graphs, set, map, unordered_set, unordered_map

Arrays, Recursion, Stacks/Queues, Bit Manipulation
You will want to know recursion (remember the termination clause!!) and linked lists. Same for Stacks and Queues. Questions involving bit manipulation are rare but are encountered from time to time.
