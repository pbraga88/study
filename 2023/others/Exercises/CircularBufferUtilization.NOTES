1) What is the purpose of the check_buffer function, and what does it return?
[ANSWER] It will read the input stream of bits, of size uint8_t or uint16_t, and identify whether there are 3 consecutive bits in the circular/ring buffer

2) Can you explain the significance of the mask and how it is initialized in the check_buffer function?
[ANSWER] The mask is creating 3 consecutives set bits (1) to be compared with the input state variable.
Initially, and taking into consideration a 8bit long type (uint8_t) for the sake of the example, the mask will look like:
1100 0001
Since it's a circular/ring buffer, the mask must rotate in a way that all the positions are validated:
1100 0001 <- Start
1110 0000
0111 0000
0011 1000
0001 1100
0000 1110
0000 0111
1000 0011 <- End
This mask rotation to the right, takes place in the for loop.

3) How does the loop in check_buffer work, and what is its purpose? How is the mask rotated within the loop?
[ANSWER] The for loop will effectively rotate the mask. Again for the sake of example, if a 8bit long type is used, the loop repeat at most 8 times. 
Within every loop, a comparison using AND operation is done to check if 3 set bits are in sequence. 
if ((state & mask) == mask)
For an input state of 186 (1011 1010):
1011 1010  & 1100 0001
false
1011 1010  & 1110 0000
false
1011 1010 & 0111 0000
false
1011 1010 & 0011 1000
true

The mask rotation happens in the line:
mask = (mask >> 1) | ((mask & 1) << (sizeof(T) * 8 -1));
Where, the mask is 1-shifted to the right and whatever is on the least significant bit becomes the leading bit by being shifted to the left by '(Tsize * 8) -1'
1100 0001 <- Start
1110 0000
0111 0000
0011 1000
0001 1100
0000 1110
0000 0111
1000 0011 <- End

4) What are the reasons for using template functions in this implementation, and how does it benefit the code?
[ANSWER] I'm using template because the input can be either uint8_t or uint16. 
This adds in efficiency to the code, since the same function can be used with different data types.

5) Can you explain the purpose of the std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false) and std::cin.tie(nullptr) lines in the main function? 
How do these optimizations affect the performance of I/O operations?
[ANSWER] They are used for performance optimization related to I/O.
std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false) will break the native synchronism between C++ standard stream and C standard input. 
When set to false, no mix of C++ standard stream and C standard input (printf, scanf) shall be used. 
std::cin.tie(nullptr) will untie std::cin from std::cout, in the sense that no longer a call to stdin will automatically flush stdout, 
making it necessary use std::endl or std::cout.flush()

6) How does the program determine whether to use an uint8_t or uint16_t type for the input state, and why was this approach chosen?
[ANSWER] By using std::numeric_limits<uint8_t>::max() to check whether the input number is within uint8_t limit or a bigger type is needed (uint16_t). 
With this the program gains in efficiency, since the allocated memory in stack will be in line with the size of the input and will also make the program faster.

7) Can you discuss the trade-offs between using std::cin and scanf for reading input values in this context?
[ANSWER] std::cin can perform better when it comes to type safety. error handling and compatibility with other C++ libs. 
On the other hand, scanf will give more control over the input formatting or when writing code which shall be compatible with both C and C++

8) How would you handle cases where the input number is larger than the range of uint16_t?
[ANSWER] Using an if condition, after reading from cin, and if the number bigger than td::numeric_limits<uint16_t>::max(), exit the program. 
Alternatively I could try/catch, throwing specific error under the same circumstance described.

9) How would you modify the code to handle different buffer lengths, such as detecting a sequence of 4 or 5 consecutive set bits instead of 3?
[ANSWER] I'd add a few defines to make clearer for the reader what's being done. Something like:
#define LEAD_BITS_2 0x03 // 0000 0011
#define LEAD_BITS_3 0x07 // 0000 0111
#define LEAD_BITS_4 0x0F // 0000 1111
#define LEAD_BITS_5 0x1F // 0001 1111

and the mask would look like, for each of the defined lead bits:
T mask = (LEAD_BITS_2 << (sizeof(T) * 8 - 2)) | 1;
T mask = (LEAD_BITS_3 << (sizeof(T) * 8 - 3)) | 1;
T mask = (LEAD_BITS_4 << (sizeof(T) * 8 - 4)) | 1;
T mask = (LEAD_BITS_5 << (sizeof(T) * 8 - 5)) | 1;

10) Are there any possible improvements or optimizations that could be made to the current implementation?
[ANSWER] - Define the set lead bits directly:
#define LEAD_BITS_2 0x03 // 0000 0011
[...]
T mask = (LEAD_BITS_2 << (sizeof(T) * 8 - 2)) | 1;
- Eliminate the for loop by using a better (bitwise) algorithm:
    template <typename T>
    bool check_buffer(T state) {
        if (state == ((LEAD_BITS_2 << sizeof(T) * 8 - 2) | 1) ||
            state == ((LEAD_BITS_1 << sizeof(T) * 8 - 1) | 3) ||
            (state & (state << 1) & (state << 2)) != 0 ) {
                return true;
            }
        return false;
    }
