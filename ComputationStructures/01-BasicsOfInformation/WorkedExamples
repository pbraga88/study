For the problems below enter your responses as a formula in the form log2(X/Y) 
where X and Y are integers, or as an integer number of bits.

1) Someone picks a name out of a hat known to contain the names of 5 women 
and 3 men, and tells you a man has been selected. How much information have they 
given you about the selection?
N = 8
M = 3
I(data) = log2(8/3) = 1,415


2) You are asked to guess a random 4-bit 2's complement number. I then tell you 
that the number is >0. How much information have you been given?
N = 16
M = 7
I(data) = log2(16/7) = 1,193
