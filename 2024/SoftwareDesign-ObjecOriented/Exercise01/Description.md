# Car rental domain model 
## We need to design the domain model of a car rental application. The car rental application has the following requirements:   
### 1 - We should be able to add new rentals, delete rentals and search rentals.  
### 2 - For every rental we need to store the name, phone, email, street, city and zip code of the customer. We also need to keep track of the start date of the rental, the maximum duration of the rental and the end date of the rental.  
### 3 - The application should also support the functionality reserve cars. For every reservation you make, you need to keep track of the date you reserved it.  
### 4 - The application should support the fact that we have multiple cars of the same type. So we might have 8 Ford F-150 Pick-up trucks available
